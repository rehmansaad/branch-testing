I can't fool another person. When I try to do that, I always assume the other person will be as smart as I am, so I never bullshit them. Similarly, I can't put forward a lousy argument. I just can't say it out unless it's solidly logical, because I always assume the other person will look at criticially. 


See what I meant?
