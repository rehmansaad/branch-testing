Depressed people tend to think things through. 

- So my depression has enabled me to be better at maths and analysis. 
- It has allowed me to be good at verbal skills, because I am critical of the meanings of the words I speak. And grammar. 
- It has made me a better/poorer decision maker, because I don't overlook the negatives any option can bring forth. 


Happy people tend to be over optimistic. 

- So they keep pushing in the face of failure, tehy're persistent. And as I know, I don't handle failure very well. Getting shit scared even before failure is evident. 
- They take risks, overestimate the likelihood of success in any event. In today's world, being risky is a good thing. So I am at a loss here, or advantage, depending whether risks is a good or bad thing.
