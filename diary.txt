I feel this pain. It's in my throat. And I feel this strong, intense urge to drive a knife in my heart. I know exactly the point I want to dig it in. Something is there in that spot. It throbs so painfully. WIth every bang on my chest wall, it reminds me how lonely, how crazy, how cruel I am. How alone I am. I see myself getting up from my bed, going to the kitchen, fetching the strongest knife there is. I look at it. It's blunt. It's weak too, The blade will probably bend when I hunt that thorobbing lump. 

If I was not afraid of hell, by God I would have done it. If doing this did not mean that I didn't believe in Allah's mercy, by God I would have done it. I have a very weak faith. I am empty. But the reason I still live on in misery, is not because I feel good things are coming my way. But because I am scared to show that I don't feel that. 

I wish someone knew this. I wish someone wanted to find out. And fix it. I really don't want to die. I want to do so much! But as it is, I have this thumping heart. A strong desire to silence it. And a very hurtful existence.
